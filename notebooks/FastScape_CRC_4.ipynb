    "The simplest way to include hillslope processes consists in asuming that transport along hillslopes is linearly proportional to local topographic gradient; combining such a simple transport law with the principle of conservation of mass leads to a simple linear diffusion equaiton/term that needs to be added to the topographic evolution equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t}=0=U-K_fA^mS^n+K_d\\nabla^2 h$$\n",

    "where $K_d$ is a transport coefficient and $\\nabla^2$ the Laplacian operator, which is very similar to topography curvature. This simple model predicts that region of negative curvature (hill tops) should erode while regions of positive curvature (valley bottoms) should accumulate sediment.\n",
